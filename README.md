# vite-project

## Description

This Project is a portfolio that is in development but is the starting point of using Vite with React. I decided to use Vite in stead of Create React App, due to the growing speed and usage of Vite. I also built this project this way because I would like to continue to build upon this an develop a back end with this using either NextJS or Express so users can contact me via the Contact Me page. Throughout the project, I learned how to integrate a CSS framework with React and use React Router to be able to go from page to page. Overall, this project is something that is a good framework for employers to see what I can do and the tools I can integrate.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Usage](#usage)
- [Tools](#tools)


## Usage

When a user visits the site, they are welcomed to the home page with very brief description. When they shift views to say the About Me, then they get an explanation of who I am, but the header, footer, and theme are the same.
